    <p>If you love Indian food you have to try this recipe! 
        This <strong>Curry</strong> tastes just as good as what you’d get at an Indian restaurant, if not better, and it’s easy to make.</p>
    <p>Brimming with flavor thanks to all the spices, it’s rich and creamy and it’s amazingly hearty when you finish it off with basmati rice or naan bread. </p>
